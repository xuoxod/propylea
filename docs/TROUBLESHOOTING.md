## ⚡ 1. The 30-Second Diagnostic Checklist

When investigating any connectivity or routing issue, run through these 5 rapid checks in order:

```text
[1] Is the Propylea process running?
    systemctl status propylea  (or: pgrep -la propylea)

[2] Are ports 80 and 443 actively bound?
    ss -tulpn | grep -E ':80 |:443 '

[3] Does the configuration pass strict validation?
    propylea check --config /etc/propylea/propylea.toml

[4] Is the upstream application healthy and listening?
    curl -I http://127.0.0.1:<upstream_port>/healthz

[5] What are the live gateway logs saying?
    journalctl -u propylea -n 50 --no-pager -f
```

## 🔍 2. Common Scenarios & Immediate Solutions

### Scenario A: `502 Bad Gateway: Upstream Unavailable`
* **Symptoms**: Clients receive a clean `502 Bad Gateway` error page when requesting a domain.
* **Root Cause**: Propylea received the request, matched the domain, but could not establish a TCP connection to the configured upstream IP/port.
* **Immediate Fixes**:
  1. Check your upstream service status (e.g. `systemctl status rmediatech` or `systemctl status livekit`).
  2. Verify that the port in `/etc/propylea/propylea.toml` matches the port your app is listening on:
     ```bash
     # Check what is actually listening locally
     ss -tulpn | grep 127.0.0.1
     ```
  3. Test direct local connection to the upstream port:
     ```bash
     curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8081/healthz
     ```
  4. Ensure your upstream service is bound to `127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0` (not an external interface only).

### Scenario B: `Address already in use (os error 98)`
* **Symptoms**: Propylea fails to start with:
  `Error: I/O error: Address already in use (os error 98)`
* **Root Cause**: Another service is already holding port 80 or 443. This commonly happens if Nginx, Caddy, Apache, or Conduit is still running.
* **Immediate Fixes**:
  1. Identify the competing process:
     ```bash
     sudo ss -tulpn | grep -E ':80 |:443 '
     ```
  2. If Nginx is running:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl stop nginx
     sudo systemctl disable nginx
     ```
  3. If Conduit or Caddy is running on ports 80/443:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl stop conduit
     sudo systemctl stop caddy
     ```
  4. Start Propylea again:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start propylea
     ```

---

### Scenario C: `Permission Denied binding to port 80/443`
* **Symptoms**: Starting Propylea as a non-root user fails with:
  `Permission denied (os error 13)`
* **Root Cause**: Linux restricts ports `< 1024` to `root` by default.
* **Immediate Fixes**:
  Grant Propylea the Linux kernel capability to bind low ports without running as root:
  ```bash
  sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/local/bin/propylea
  ```
  Verify the capability is set:
  ```bash
  getcap /usr/local/bin/propylea
  # Expected output: /usr/local/bin/propylea cap_net_bind_service=ep
  ```

---

### Scenario D: `TLS Handshake Error / Certificate Mismatch`
* **Symptoms**: Browser reports `SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN` or `PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR`.
* **Root Cause**: Missing certificate file, unreadable file permissions, or the domain requested in the browser does not match any entry in `domains = [...]`.
* **Immediate Fixes**:
  1. Run the strict config check:
     ```bash
     propylea check --config /etc/propylea/propylea.toml
     ```
     This validates whether every certificate and private key file exists, is valid PEM, and can be read by the current user.
  2. Ensure the `propylea` user has read permission on `/etc/letsencrypt/live/...`:
     ```bash
     sudo chmod 755 /etc/letsencrypt/live /etc/letsencrypt/archive
     sudo chmod 644 /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/fullchain.pem
     sudo chmod 640 /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/privkey.pem
     sudo chgrp propylea /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/privkey.pem
     ```
  3. Ensure the domain requested by the client is included in the route's `domains` array.

---

### Scenario E: `WebSocket Connection Drops / 1006 Abnormal Closure`
* **Symptoms**: Real-time apps (LiveKit WebRTC signaling, Matrix sync, chat websockets) fail to connect or disconnect immediately upon connecting.
* **Root Cause**: `websocket = true` is either missing from the route block, or the upstream server does not return `HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols`.
* **Immediate Fixes**:
  1. Inspect `/etc/propylea/propylea.toml` under the relevant route:
     ```toml
     [[routes]]
     domains = ["sfu.rmediatech.com"]
     upstream = "127.0.0.1:7880"
     cert = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/sfu.rmediatech.com/fullchain.pem"
     key = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/sfu.rmediatech.com/privkey.pem"
     websocket = true  # <-- MUST BE TRUE
     ```
  2. Reload Propylea:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart propylea
     ```

---

### Scenario F: `Legitimate Endpoint Returning 404 (Perimeter Trap False Positive)`
* **Symptoms**: A normal user or internal webhook receives a stealth `404 Not Found` even though the upstream application provides that URL.
* **Root Cause**: The URL matches a known scanner decoy pattern in the embedded Phylax threat trie (e.g. `/.env`, `/.git`, `/admin/config.php`, `/wp-login.php`).
* **Immediate Fixes**:
  1. Check the logs to see if the path was intercepted by the defense engine:
     ```bash
     journalctl -u propylea | grep "Hostile reconnaissance scan trapped"
     ```
  2. If an internal tool legitimately requires one of these paths (e.g., `/admin`), change the route path in your upstream application to a sovereign, custom path (e.g., `/dashboard` or `/control`). The decoy trie intentionally prevents access to common default attack vectors.
  3. To temporarily test whether defense is causing the issue, disable defense in `/etc/propylea/propylea.toml`:
     ```toml
     [security]
     enable_defense = false
     ```
     and restart Propylea.

## 🛠️ 3. Verification & Live Testing Commands

### Test 1: Verify HTTP to HTTPS 301 Redirect
```bash
curl -I http://rmediatech.com
```
*Expected Output:*
```http
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
location: https://rmediatech.com/
server: Aegis-Apollo-Proxy-Service/4.12
```

---

### Test 2: Verify Active Defense Decoy Trap
Send a simulated hostile probe:
```bash
curl -I https://rmediatech.com/.env
```
*Expected Output:*
```http
HTTP/2 404 Not Found
server: Aegis-Apollo-Proxy-Service/4.12
```
*And in the server logs:*
```text
WARN [PROPYLEA-EDGE] Hostile reconnaissance scan trapped at ingress
     ├── Remote IP: <your_ip>
     ├── Target URI: GET /.env
     └── Action: Intercepted in 11ns (stealth 404 returned, 0 bytes proxied upstream)
```

---

### Test 3: Check Memory Footprint (RSS)
```bash
ps -o pid,rss,vsz,comm -p $(pgrep propylea)
```
*Expected Output:*
```text
  PID   RSS    VSZ COMMAND
58059 11420 184500 propylea
```
*RSS should remain `< 15,000 KB` (`< 15 MB`).*

---

### Test 4: Manually Trigger Memory Vacuum
Propylea automatically runs memory hygiene every `hygiene_interval_secs` (default 300s). You can check hygiene passes in the journal:
```bash
journalctl -u propylea | grep "GOVERNOR"
```
*Expected Output:*
```text
DEBUG [GOVERNOR] Executing autonomous resource hygiene pass
      └── Memory Vacuum: malloc_trim(0) returned unmapped pages to kernel
```
