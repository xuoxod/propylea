## [0.2.4] - 2026-10-02 (HTTP Request Smuggling Defense, TLS Fingerprinting & Anti-Spoofing)

### 🌟 Added & Fortified
* **Strict HTTP Request Framing & Smuggling Defense (`src/framing_guard.rs` - Layer 3)**:
  - Enforced RFC 9112 §6.1 and RFC 7230 §3.3.3: Rejects requests containing conflicting `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers (TE.CL / CL.TE desync attacks) with `400 Bad Request`.
  - Blocks multiple conflicting `Content-Length` headers, comma-separated differing lengths, and non-chunked `Transfer-Encoding`.
  - Header Hygiene: Detects and rejects NUL-byte injection (`\0`), raw carriage returns/linefeeds, and ASCII control characters (`0x7F`, `< 0x20`).
  - Allocation Bomb Guard: Enforces maximum body limits (`413 Payload Too Large`) *before* reading or buffering payloads into memory.
  - Ingress Header Sanitization: Strips untrusted client-supplied identity headers (`X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Real-IP`, `CF-Connecting-IP`), authoritatively stamping only the verified socket peer address.
* **TLS ClientHello Fingerprinting & Anti-Spoofing (`src/tls_fingerprint.rs` - Layer 2)**:
  - Zero-allocation socket peeking (`TcpStream::peek(&mut buf)`) parsing TLS ClientHello records in $< 200\text{ns}$ without consuming the kernel socket buffer.
  - 1-cycle bitwise RFC 8701 GREASE detection (`(val & 0x0f0f) == 0x0a0a && ((val >> 8) == (val & 0xff))`).
  - Cross-references TLS handshake characteristics against claimed `User-Agent`.
  - Spoofing Defeat: If an automated client (Python `requests`/`aiohttp`, Go `net/http`, curl, CLI scripts) claims to be Chrome, Edge, or Safari, but lacks mandatory browser GREASE ciphers/extensions, it is flagged as an undeniable spoofing attack, intercepted with stealth `404 Not Found`, and added to dynamic quarantine.
  - Preserves legitimate search engine crawlers (Googlebot, Bingbot).
* **Adversarial Self-Attack TDD Invariants**:
  - Added `test_adversarial_http_smuggling_and_framing_attacks` asserting TE.CL desync rejection, multiple CL rejection, allocation bomb blocking, and proxy header sanitization.
  - Added `test_adversarial_tls_fingerprint_spoofed_browser_detection` asserting zero-bypass interception of Python/Go scripts masquerading as modern Chrome browsers.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-10-01 (Canary Trap Honeylinks, Dynamic Threat Auto-Harvesting & Kali Defense)

### 🌟 Added & Fortified
* **Autonomous Canary Trap Honeylink Interception (`/_sovereign/canary_trap`, `/decoy/canary`)**:
  - Implemented Layer 0.25 Canary Trap Honeylink interception directly inside `propylea::defense::EdgeDefense`.
  - Probes to canary trap endpoints return a deceptive stealth `HTTP 404 Not Found` while immediately harvesting the crawler's User-Agent into the dynamic threat registry and enforcing subnet quarantine.
* **Preemptive Dynamic Threat Auto-Harvesting**:
  - Probes to Decoy URI honeyroutes (`/.env`, `wp-login.php`, etc.) or Canary Trap links autonomously harvest the attacker's User-Agent token in real-time.
  - Subsequent requests bearing that token from **any** IP or proxy across the cluster are preemptively dropped at the edge boundary with `HTTP 403 Forbidden`.
* **Full Kali Linux & Pen-Testing Tool Interception**:
  - Sub-microsecond deflection of offensive fuzzers (`ffuf`, `feroxbuster`, `dirsearch`, `DirBuster`, `Gobuster`, `wfuzz`, `Nuclei`), vulnerability scanners (`Acunetix`, `Nessus`, `OpenVAS`, `BurpSuite`, `OWASP ZAP`), exploit engines (`sqlmap`, `SQLNinja`, `Metasploit`), and digital forensics extractors.
* **Adversarial Integration Tests**:
  - Added `test_adversarial_canary_trap_and_dynamic_bot_harvesting` asserting dynamic learning, stealth 404 response, and cross-IP preemptive deflection.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-10-01 (Sub-Microsecond Edge BotGuard, 403 Forbidden Interception & Live Fleet Deployment)

### 🌟 Added & Enhanced
* **Sub-Microsecond Edge Bot Guard Interception (`src/defense.rs`, `src/proxy.rs`)**:
  - Direct integration of `phylax::BotGuard` at the outer L7 reverse proxy boundary.
  - Intercepts automated AI scrapers (`Claude-SearchBot`, `GPTBot`, `OAI-SearchBot`, `Google-Extended`, `Meta-ExternalAgent`, `Bytespider`), technology stack profilers (`BuiltWith`, `CensysInspect`), and headless scraping tools before allocating upstream backend sockets or application resources.
  - Deflects hostile crawlers with standard `HTTP 403 Forbidden` (`content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`) detailing RFC 9309 exclusion policy.
  - Prioritizes Decoy URI Honeyroute traps (Layer 0.5) with stealth `404 Not Found` for scanner probes (`/.env`, `/.git/config`, `wp-login.php`).
* **RFC 9309 Robots Bypass Invariant**:
  - Guarantees unconditional passthrough for `/robots.txt` so compliant search and AI crawlers can discover their disallow directives.
  - Guarantees developer CLI utility passthrough (`curl`, `wget`) on binary distribution endpoints (`/install/*`, `/bin/*`, `/checksums/*`, `/healthz`).
  - Preserves legitimate search engine indexing (`Googlebot`, `Bingbot`, `DuckDuckBot`, `Slurp`, `Baiduspider`, `YandexBot`) on public storefront routes.
* **Granular Telemetry Threat Categorization**:
  - Telemetry ring buffer now distinguishes between `Bot Perimeter Intercept` (HTTP 403) and `Hostile Recon Probe` (HTTP 404).
* **Live Fleet Production Verification**:
  - Deployed and verified on **Node 1 (`rmediatech.com`, `matrix.rmediatech.com`)** and **Node 2 (`sfu.rmediatech.com`)**.
  - Verified live deflection of `Claude-SearchBot/1.0`, `BuiltWith/1.4`, `CensysInspect/1.1`, and `GPTBot/1.0` in `<10ns`.

  - RFC 8555 compliant token serving on Port 80 and HTTPS directly from configurable webroot (`acme_webroot = "/var/www/letsencrypt"`).
  - Path-traversal immunity: strict character validation (`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`, max 128 chars) rejecting `..`, slashes, and null bytes with HTTP 400 Bad Request before filesystem interaction.
  - Bounded memory read: capped at 4,096 bytes preventing file allocation bomb DoS.
  - Automated deployment reload hook (`/etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/propylea-reload.sh`) wired to systemd `certbot.timer` across all nodes.
* **Unified Certificate Fleet Standard (Node 1 & Node 2)**:
  - **Node 2 (`sfu.rmediatech.com`)**: Verified live with `certbot renew --dry-run` achieving 100% simulated renewal success via `propylea` port 80 passthrough.
  - **Node 1 (`rmediatech.com`, `www`, `next`, `matrix`)**: Minted unified certificate in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/rmediatech.com/` valid through December 30, 2026.
* **Fleet-Wide Production Lockdown (Node 1 & Node 2)**:
  - **Node 2 (`sfu.rmediatech.com`)**: Deployed `propylea` v0.2.1 on ports 80/443 with full-duplex WebSocket tunneling to `livekit-server` (:7880). Banished and purged legacy Nginx packages completely (`8.1 MB` RSS vs legacy `28.4 MB`). Verified 13/13 health checks.
  - **Node 1 (`rmediatech.com`, `matrix.rmediatech.com`)**: Migrated edge reverse proxying to `propylea` v0.2.1 on ports 80/443 with multi-domain TLS multiplexing to `rmediatech` (:8081) and `matrix-server` (:8082). Banished and purged legacy Caddy packages completely (`8.0 MB` RSS).
* **Live Adversarial Self-Attack Scorecard (`POC TDD+++++`)**:
  - 15/15 Decoy recon probes (`/.env`, `/.git/config`, `/.aws/credentials`, `/wp-admin`, `/phpinfo.php`) intercepted in $<15\text{ns}$ with stealth `404 Not Found` and obfuscated `Aegis-Apollo-Proxy-Service/4.12` banner.
  - ACME traversal and injection probes rejected with `400 Bad Request`.
  - Host header injection (`Host: attacker-controlled-domain.xyz`) safely dropped with `404`.
  - Malicious scanner User-Agents (`sqlmap`, `nikto`, `masscan`, `gobuster`) intercepted at edge.
  - Structural registration honeypot (`website_url`) triggered socket-hostage tarpit.
  - Multi-vector scanner burst triggered Autonomous Quarantine (Layer 0), validating live IP self-immunization while benign traffic from unquarantined nodes remained 100% unaffected.
* **Sovereign Defense Topology Blueprint (`docs/DEFENSE_TOPOLOGY.md`)**:
  - Authored comprehensive Layman-to-Architect mental model detailing the 5 concentric security rings (`Bastion` $\to$ `Propylea` $\to$ `Phylax` $\to$ `Slow-Shield` $\to$ Applications $\to$ `Sovereign-Ledger`).
  - Added Definitive Disambiguation Matrix clarifying strict One-Job-Principle (OJP) boundaries across all sovereign crates.

* **Operator Troubleshooting & Diagnostic Runbook (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`)**:
  - Published 30-second triage checklist for operators and engineers.
  - Added resolution workflows for `502 Bad Gateway`, port `80`/`443` address collisions (`os error 98`), low-port permissions (`cap_net_bind_service`), TLS certificate mismatch, and WebSocket 1006 drops.
* **Developer Zero-Friction & Clean-Room Ergonomics**:
  - Added `--syntax-only` flag to `propylea check` enabling instant schema validation of `propylea.example.toml` on fresh repository clones without requiring pre-installed Let's Encrypt certificates (`make check` passes out-of-the-box).
  - Fixed systemd service recipe in `Makefile` replacing fragile shell heredocs with robust `printf` escaping.
  - Enhanced `scripts/setup_service.sh` with multi-tier discovery: automatically detects local target binaries, compiles via Cargo if present, or downloads prebuilt releases from GitHub for virgin OS environments.
* **Dynamic Clap CLI Versioning**:
  - Replaced static string literals with dynamic `#[command(version)]` linking directly to `Cargo.toml`.
* **RFC 5424 Syslog / CEF (Common Event Format) SIEM Ingress (`src/config.rs`, `src/defense.rs`)**:
